# ChatGPT-Google-search
A ChatGPT-enhanced google search. 


Algorithm:

2. Take the answer from the prompt as a query for google search
3. Calculate the distances between the embedding of the answer with the list of search items
4. Return a ranked list of the search items based on lowest embedding distance


To Start:

You need to generate an OpenAI API key and a google custom search API key. Additionally you need to make a custom search engine with google [here](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/)

"With ChatGPT-Enhanced, users can simply type or speak their search queries as they would to a friend, and the tool will understand the intent behind the query and provide relevant search results. This makes it easier and more natural for users to find the information they need, without having to remember specific keywords or phrases." -ChatGPT
